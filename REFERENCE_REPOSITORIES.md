# Reference Repositories Analysis

This document tracks reference repositories used for this project's development.

## Available References

### 1. ✅ `stevei101/infrastructure` - Infrastructure Patterns
**URL:** https://github.com/stevei101/infrastructure  
**Status:** ✅ Accessible

**Key Patterns:**
- Centralized Terraform configurations
- GitHub Actions workflows for Terraform
- Terraform Cloud backend setup
- Workload Identity Federation (WIF) patterns
- TFSec security scanning workflows
- Reusable workflow patterns

**Useful for:**
- Terraform workflow patterns
- WIF configuration examples
- Security scanning setup

### 2. ✅ `principle-lgtm/lumina-search-rag` - RAG Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Documented (see `LUMINA_REFERENCE_NOTES.md`)

**Key Patterns:**
- Gemini API direct integration
- Message format for Gemini API
- RAG context injection
- Streaming support (SSE)

### 3. ❌ `stevei101/ai-search-rag-with-g` - Unknown/Inaccessible
**URL:** https://github.com/stevei101/ai-search-rag-with-g  
**Status:** ❌ Returns 404 (Not Found)

**Possible reasons:**
- Repository is private (requires authentication)
- Repository name is different
- Repository hasn't been created yet
- Repository was renamed or deleted

## Next Steps

**To access `ai-search-rag-with-g`:**

1. **Check if it's private:**
   - If private, grant access or provide a token
   - Or share the repository contents directly

2. **Verify the repository name:**
   - Confirm exact spelling/format
   - Check for variations (e.g., `ai-search-rag-with-vertex-ai`, `ai-search-rag-gemini`)

3. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Share key files from the repository
   - Describe what patterns you want me to extract
   - Point me to specific documentation

## What I Can Help With

Based on the `infrastructure` repository patterns I found, I can help with:

1. **Terraform Workflows:**
   - Using reusable workflows from `infrastructure` repo
   - WIF setup patterns
   - Terraform Cloud configuration

2. **Current Project Patterns:**
   - Already using Terraform Cloud backend
   - GitHub Actions workflow structure
   - Service account key generation (automatic via Terraform)

## Questions

1. Is `ai-search-rag-with-g` a private repository?
2. What specific patterns or configurations should I look for in that repository?
3. Should I proceed with patterns from the `infrastructure` repository for now?
